# IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition

The IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition project aims to develop a machine learning model (classification) to predict whether an employee will leave the company (attrition) or not. This project uses a fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists to uncover the factors leading to employee attrition.

## Overview

Employee attrition, or turnover, is a significant concern for many organizations, as it can lead to increased costs, loss of knowledge, and decreased morale. Understanding the factors that contribute to employee attrition can help companies implement strategies to retain talent.

## The Objective

The primary objective of this project is to identify employees at risk of leaving the company. By analyzing significant predictors, the model aims to help organizations reduce turnover and retain valuable employees.



## The Data

The dataset contains 1.470 records detailing attributes of employees. These features include information that is mandatorily collected by the company's registration process, and others that need to be provided by the employee themselves, in the case of job satisfaction.



## Business Impact

A successful classification model can significantly impact HR strategies and business outcomes:

- **Talent Retention:** Identify at-risk employees and implement targeted retention strategies to reduce turnover.
- **Cost Reduction:** Decrease costs associated with hiring and training new employees by retaining existing talent.
- **Employee Satisfaction:** Improve overall employee satisfaction and morale by addressing factors contributing to attrition.
- **Strategic Planning:** Provide data-driven insights to inform HR policies and strategic planning.
