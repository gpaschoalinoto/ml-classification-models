# Coral Reefs Worldwide Distribution - UNESCO Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission

The Coral Reefs Worldwide Distribution project aims to develop a machine learning model (classification) to predict which seas could be potential homes for corals based on the characteristics of the world's ocean areas. This project is critical for understanding and protecting coral habitats globally. It is a challenge from UNESCO and other partners, presented by FIAP.

## Overview

Healthy corals are the foundation of our ocean's food chain and are crucial to our economy. Coral reefs support fishing and tourism industries, provide millions of jobs, and contribute significantly to global economies. They are also sources of important pharmaceuticals for treating cancer, arthritis, and viruses. Additionally, coral reefs act as natural barriers protecting coastal communities from high-impact waves. However, corals face threats from pollution and climate change, making their protection essential. Since the discovery of cold-water corals inhabiting depths worldwide, studying coral distribution has become a significant challenge. Not only do shallow and warm tropical waters serve as coral habitats, but cold and dark depths near Antarctica and the Arctic can also be home to corals. This project seeks understand what factors may influence the distribution of corals around the world and to create a predictive model to identify which ocean areas are suitable for corals, both hard and soft.

## The Objective

The main goal of this project is to identify the factors affecting coral distribution worldwide and predict potential coral habitats. By understanding these factors, the model aims to contribute to efforts to protect and preserve coral reef ecosystems.

## The Data

The dataset contains 2.471 records detailing the distribution of corals in various ocean areas.

- **corals:** Presence of corals, is the prediction target.
- **name:** Sea name.
- **salinity:** Practical salinity units of sea water surface.
- **January_temp:** Temperature of sea water surface in Celsius degrees in January.
- **June_temp:** Temperature of sea water surface in Celsius degrees in June.
- **area:** Area of sea in square kilometers.
- **latitude:** The latitude coordinate rounded of the sea.
- **longitude:** The longitude coordinate rounded of the sea.
- **type of sea:** Types of sea.
- **silt/sulfide:** Presence of silt/sulfide in sea water.

## Business Impact

A successful classification model can significantly impact conservation efforts and policy-making:

- **Conservation Efforts:** Identify potential coral habitats, aiding in the protection and restoration of coral reefs.
- **Policy Making:** Provide data-driven insights for developing policies aimed at preserving marine biodiversity.
- **Scientific Research:** Support further research on coral ecosystems and their distribution.
- **Economic Benefits:** Ensure sustainable fishing and tourism industries by protecting coral reefs.
